            <p>Dementia Network Calgary and the Alzheimers Society of Calgary want to know what you really think.
                We are asking important questions to understand what you really think and feel about Alzheimer’s
                disease and related dementias. There’s zero judgement and it’s completely anonymous. Your voice will
                help us develop the right plans to build greater awareness and understanding in our community. Thank
                you so much for taking a few brief moments to share your thoughts.</p>
